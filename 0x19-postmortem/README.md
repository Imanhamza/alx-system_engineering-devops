### Issue Summary:
Outage Duration:(date), 14:30 - (date), 17:45 (UTC+2)
Impact: Slow response and intermittent downtime for our e-commerce platform, affecting approximately 20% of users.

### Timeline:
* 14:30: Issue detected by a monitoring alert indicating a surge in response time.
* 14:32: EnginOps team notified and begins investigation.
* 14:45: Initial assumption points to high server load due to increased traffic.
* 15:00: Load balancers and database servers inspected, but no anomalies found.
* 15:30: Misleading path taken in analyzing network performance, leading to no significant findings.
* 16:00: Incident escalated to Senior DevOps Engineer for further analysis.
* 16:15: Senior DevOps Engineer identifies abnormal database queries as potential root cause.
* 16:30: Incident reported to Backend Development team to investigate database queries.
* 17:00: Development team confirms inefficient queries causing database overload.
* 17:30: Inefficient queries optimized and deployed to production.
* 17:45: Platform performance stabilizes, incident resolved.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
**Root Cause:** The slowdown was caused by a series of inefficient database queries triggered by an update in the recommendation algorithm, leading to an unexpected increase in database load.

**Resolution:** The inefficient queries were identified, optimized, and tested in a controlled environment. Once confirmed stable, the optimized queries were deployed to production, alleviating the database load and restoring normal response times.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. Review and optimize all critical database queries to prevent similar issues in the future.
2. Implement query performance monitoring and alerting to identify inefficient queries early.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. Update database query optimization guidelines for developers.
2. Enhance automated testing to include stress tests simulating peak traffic loads.
3. Establish a regular performance review process for critical components.
---
**In conclusion**, the recent e-commerce platform outage on August 10th was traced back to inefficient database queries triggered by an algorithm update. Although the root cause was identified and resolved promptly, it served as a reminder of the importance of ongoing monitoring and optimization. To prevent future incidents, we are implementing measures to enhance query optimization guidelines, stress testing, and regular performance reviews. Our goal is to ensure a seamless user experience and maintain the reliability of our platform.
